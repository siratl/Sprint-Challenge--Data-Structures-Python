Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
   -- O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
   -- Since no additional memory was used I believe the space complexity is O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
   -- O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
   -- Probably O(n) since the array called is filled with non None values when called

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   -- Because of the nested for-loop which will loop through both lists it will be O(n\*\*2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   -- O(n) the memory required to run will grow in proportion to number of inputs

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   -- O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   -- O(n) the memory required to run will grow in proportion to number of inputs
